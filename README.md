# Hugo Encryptor

**Hugo-Encryptor** is a tool to protect your [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) posts. It uses AES-256 to encrypt the contents of your posts, and inserts a snippet of `<script>` code to verify whether the password is correct or not in readers' browser. Without a correct key, nobody can decrypt your private posts.

## Configuration

Although the **Hugo-Encryptor** can run without any configure, we provide some settings params to help you configure **Hugo-Encryptor** to your liking.

### Language

As default,**Hugo-Encryptor** displays in Chinese, by adding `hugoEncryptorLanguage` param in your blog's config file, you can change the language into English. Such as below:

```toml
[params]
 		 ......
  hugoEncryptorLanguage = "en-us" # or "zh-cn"
```

### The way of client password storage

As default,**Hugo-Encryptor** use `localStorage` to storage the password's md5 in client. By adding `hugoEncryptorStorage` param in your blog's config file, you can change the storage method into `sessionStorage`. Such as below:

```toml
[params]
 		 ......
  hugoEncryptorStorage = "session" # or "local"
```

For the difference of two storage ways:

* **localStorage**:

  Once a reader input the correct password,the authorization status will not expire, the reader can read the article at any time without having to enter the password again. Unless you change the password or the reader clean his browser cache.

* **sessionStorage**:

  If a reader input the correct password, he could read the article without having to enter the password again until the user close his browser.

### Style

As default, **Hugo-Encryptor** has no style,but we have already give all the visual element a class name, you can add style for them in your css files.

## Attentions

* Do remember to keep the source code of your encrypted posts private. Never push your blog directory into a public repository.

* Every time when you generate your site, you should run `$ python hugo-encryptor` again to encrypt the posts which you want to be protected. If you are worried about you will forgot that, it's a good idea to use a shell script to take the place of  `$ hugo` ,such as below:

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  hugo
  python hugo-encryptor
  ```
